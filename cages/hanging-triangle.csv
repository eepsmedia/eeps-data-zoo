# description: Click the info button on the zoo page to see the figure. Two force sensors&comma; F1 and F2&comma; at the same height&comma; are connected by a string. A mass hangs from the string. The string is longer than the distance between the sensors&comma; so it hangs down&comma; forming a triangle. The distances from the sensors to the  mass are X1 and X2. The mass is "h" meters below the horizontal.
