# description: The curator dropped small&comma; strong magnets though an "eddy tube&comma;" a thick copper pipe. There were two magnets (total mass 17.7g) forming a "sandwich" of a varying number of pennies (2.66g each). The moving magnetic field sets up electrical currents in the pipe&comma; which in turn set up a magnetic field&comma; which -- doesn't it just figure? -- opposes the field of the permanent magnets&comma; making them slow down.&NewLine;&NewLine;
